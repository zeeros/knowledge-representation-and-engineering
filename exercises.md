# Introduction and Concepts

-   **Exercise 1:** What is **data**? What is **information**? What is **knowledge**?
    -   **Data:** A raw value without context, it simply exists in its form (either usable or not)
    -   **Information:** Data + Meaning, it can change the perception of the receiver about something
        -   **Meanings:** The **five C&rsquo;s of Davenport & Prusak** describe what can give meaning to data
            -   **Contextualization:** Purpose of data
            -   **Categorization:** Classified or generalization to concepts
            -   **Calculation:** Mathematical or statistical analysis
            -   **Correction:** Removal of erros
            -   **Condensation:** Removal of unnecessary elements
    -   **Knowledge:** Information + &ldquo;something&rdquo;, generalized to increase applicability. What is &ldquo;something&rdquo;?
        -   The **four C&rsquo;s of Davenport & Prusak** describe what &ldquo;something&rdquo; can be
            -   **Comparison:** Similarity to other contexts
            -   **Consequence:** Implication in decision taking
            -   **Connection:** Relationship with other information
            -   **Conversation:** Feedback of people
        -   **Tobin:** &ldquo;something&rdquo; \* application
-   **Exercises 2:** Identify the underlined sentences of the following paragraphs as **data**, **information** or **knowledge**.
-   **Exercise 3:** Identify **know-what** and **know-how** knowledge

About the following exercises

-   Exercises 2 and 3 are grouped together for convenience
-   The paragraphs are already splitted into separate sentences for the same reason
-   We adopt these conventions: `this is data` *this is its meaning*
    -   **Knowledge:** extracted from the sentence above
    -   **Know-what:** if the extracted knowledge can be interpreted as a fact
    -   **Know-how:** if the extracted knowledge can be interpreted as a rule
